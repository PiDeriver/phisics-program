Found out by a YAHOO post that the apps are in something called z80 Assembly. It also said that I need the SDK from Texas Instruments to make apps. Several
 of the links didn't work. Only one that did led to a tutorial for the wrong calculator.

TI 84 “source developer’s kit” (https://education.ti.com/en-GB/uk/products/software-development-kits-sdk)
THER IS NO SDK FOR IT! JUST A DOWNLOAD FOR A GUIDE! SSSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wasted an hour to find this out and looking for a download from multiple websites.

Have to make program and use BASIC converter. It might be interesting to learn how to use BASIC.

The program can be done on calculator or using an emulator, but of course THERE IS NO SIMPLE WAY TO GET THE OS!!!!!!
Ok. I can get the OS by using a program to copy it from a calculator.

Can also be programed in assembly (http://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=84PCSE:OS:Applications)

I also started working on figuring out how to move files using Java.
