Found out by a YAHOO post that the apps are in something called z80 Assembly. It also said that I need the SDK from Texas Instruments to make apps. Several
 of the links didn't work. Only one that did led to a tutorial for the wrong calculator.

TI 84 “source developer’s kit” (https://education.ti.com/en-GB/uk/products/software-development-kits-sdk)
THER IS NO SDK FOR IT! JUST A DOWNLOAD FOR A GUIDE! SSSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wasted an hour to find this out and looking for a download from multiple websites.

Have to make program and use BASIC converter. It might be interesting to learn how to use BASIC.

The program can be done on calculator or using an emulator, but of course THERE IS NO SIMPLE WAY TO GET THE OS!!!!!!
Ok. I can get the OS by using a program to copy it from a calculator.

(http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/basicbuilder) Link for tutorials and help

Can also be programed in assembly (http://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=84PCSE:OS:Applications)

I also started working on figuring out how to move files using Java.

Apparently I am going to just have to program the app directly on my calculator. That won't be too dificult, but it will be anoying. This 
is due to the dificulty of retriveing the OS from the calculator. I also started playing with the BASIC builder to conver programs into 
apps. Apparently, what it actually does is you can put multiple programs with pictures into one app. I also need to figure out what the 
picture format is for the calculator. And I need to do more research with the bulder, because when I tried to put the app on the calculator
, it said it was imcompatible, even though it was the same format the other apps were in. Apparently either TI connect can't transfer apps,
didn't like the file, or the calculator didn't like the file. Basicaly, lots of things don't like each other at the moment. If things go 
south, I could possibly just try to shove all of the programs into one with LOTS of Gotos and, if possible for programs, I will try to add 
a GUI. But I will most likely will be able to make things work with enough reaserching. One thing that might have to happen is that I find 
a way to force the transfer. If worst comes to worst with that part, I can have a backup of the calculator ready if it compleatly breaks.

I found an online BASIC editor that allows you to select the calculator type. It can make program files but not app files. It can create
AppVar files for storing variables for later use and can't be changed without being edited, which could be useful. My best bet is using the
BASIC editor I found already, but i am still not sure how to make it work properly. I have started creating the program and the auto
-installer / File Mover. The only problem that I am currently having is trying to figure out how the file should be formated when outputed 
by the builder, and where to move the file. the calculator didn't show up in the file explorer, so I am going to have to try and research 
that.

I haven't found where the calculator is actually located yet, but I have figured out how to move files with java. I have also worked alot on
the program itself. So far I have made around 6 menus and programed in formulas for kinematics, rotational kinematics, and the Range,
momentum, and angular momentum equations also. I also have made formulas for kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy. They all include
units and breaks up the equation for the user to easly see what is going on. I also found that in the ti connect files, there are several 
OS for several different calculators. It is coming along nicely now.

For some reason, but it could just by my cord, my calculator hates staying connected to my computer. I still need to find where the calculator 
is located on the computer. The program is coming along nicely. I have added equations for force with their units. I have also made it so the 
final units are displayed after the calculation, such as Newtons for force. I havn't had time to play around with the BASIC builder due to 
homework and Norton. For some reason NOW it decides it is a threat and keept removing it. Didn't help my time situation. Made Norton stop so 
I shouldn't have any more troubles with it. All I have left to do for formulas now is waves. After that everything is going to get VERY anoying.

I started adding waves into the physics program. I added the v= f*lambda equation and just need to add units. I found a program online that will search for things plugged into my computer l, and I hope it can find the calculator. Then all I have to find out is how to take its output and insert it into the auto installer. I still need to figure out how to use the basic editor, but I haven't had much time.

I har my wisdome theeth out last week, so I really didn't get much done. I found 2 lbl errors in the program, and other than adding the equations for magnitisum, it is close to done. I found out that apparently for the BASIC editor, you need to sign the file with the SDK. I am trying to read through their manual about the SDK they dont have for downloading trying to figure thind out. The people who made the texas instrumits website did a horrible job.

I can't really deal with all of these setbacks anymore. Trying to deal with texas instrumints and everything else is difficult. I am basically going to not make it into an app anymore, and I am not going to make the auto-intsaller. since it won't be an app, it will be easy to transfer using Ti-connect(one of the few things that isn't horrible to try and download) or just through calculators. To replace what i cannot do, I will be adding more to the program. I will try to make a Kircoff's law 3x3 circut solver. I already have the gui planed and the basic layout of what i am going to do, and included it as an instructions tab right by it. I still also need to add magnitisum to the program, and if there is time, I might look into thermal or optics. Judging by the time I might only be able to add 1 of them as extra or none at all if the solver is foing to take as long as i think it will.
