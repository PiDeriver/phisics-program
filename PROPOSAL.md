# Proposal: Phisics for Calculators
## A program that installs a phisics app with a gui on ti84 plus c silver edition calculators
Kevin Sikes

## Needs and Opportunities
people can use their calcultors, but on p test, even with calculators they run you for your time. With this app, people will be able to 
save time and not need to format the equations on their calculators. They will just need to plug in the numbers.and most people do not 
know how to install things on their calculator. if it isn't compatable, i might work on a version for the ti84 silver edition

## Audience / Clients / Users
Anyone who is or will be taking phisics would like this program. I am currently taking a phisics class, i have a friend who takes a phisics class and another
friend who will be aking the class next year.

## Product
It will be an auto installer for an app that i am also going to make for the ti84 plus c silver edition.

## Timeline
What is your monthly timeline for this project. I want to see a list of
deliverables with deadlines. You may find that the timeline needs adjustment
during the course of the year, which may be fine. Check in with me if that\u2019s
the case. 

| Date          | Deliverable   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| February 26   | basic program base started. file mover started. ideas for the app gui.|
| April 1       | basic app with gui close to done. file mover close to finished |
| April 29      | Program complete and possibly 3x3 circit solver and other things if there is time|

## Reality Check
I would need at least cheap laptop (rasberry pi works). that will be somewhat expensive (Pi-$30,moniter+keyboard+mouse set-$120). I don't 
exactly need the calculator, but it would be nice for positioning the gui (can be as low as $75 for a used one on ebay). at least it would
cost around 150 dollars to set up, my targets are kids, which most likely would be willingto spare $5, and with around 30 kids per class
and 3 classes i could tap, right there i can make around $450, a net gain of around $300. I already have all of the supplies though, so 
technically it will be a $450 gain for me. you did say yo wanted a cut, and with the 30% already offered, you would recive around $135
with no investment. yes i did just kinda combine this with the last section. so my end net gain would be around $315, but that is still 
a nice amount of pocket change right off the bat.

## Conclusion
I think this is going to be very fun and painful to program at the same time. It is going to be a challenge and make money. i wrote most of the section in the last one. if $135 for 
free isn't enough to insre you... I don't really know what else will. Maby kids doing slightly better in your class will? But seriously. 
free money and helping out your students at the same time. What more can a teacher ask for (other than more free money)?
