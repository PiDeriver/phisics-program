For the gui, i can use the menu command on the calculator. I plan on having it look like this.

|PHYSICS PROGRAMS         |

|2:ENERGY                 |
|3:WAVES                  |
|4:ROTATIONAL KINEMATICS  |
|5:POLAR TO RECTANGULAR   |
|6:QUIT                   |

If possible, I will have a starting menu with a picture. I think I might have it be part of 
Schreibeard productions and if possible have it as a background picture in the menus.
after selecting something the [#:] will become bold ant the top part (PHYSICS PROGRAM) will 
be inverted so the white and black will switch. Once something is entered, it will go into 
another menu with their respective formulas, and the possiblity to go back and forth from pages.
